## An open source placeholderAPI extension for my velocity playtime plugin.
This plugin gets playtime values from my main plugin using plugin channels, and supplies them as data for placeholders.

Also supports data preloading, and has a rewards system that can be used to execute different local commands on each server.

For more info, visit the modrinth page of the plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/playtimelink
